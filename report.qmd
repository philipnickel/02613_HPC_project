To verify correctness of all solver implementations, convergence plots were generated using a Method of Manufactured Solutions (MMS) approach. The test uses a known analytical solution to Laplace's equation, applies boundary conditions, and tracks residual convergence over iterations for each implementation. Residuals were sampled every 500 iterations using the L2-norm of the discrete Laplacian.

**5.** Make a new Python program where you parallelize the computations over the floorplans. Use static scheduling such that each worker is assigned the same amount of floorplans to process. You should use no more than 100 floorplans for your timing experiments. Again, use a batch job to ensure consistent results.

**Requested hardware for the static scheduling:**

| Resource Type | Specification                    |
|---------------|----------------------------------|
| CPU           | 16 cores (Intel Xeon Gold 6226R) |
| Memory        | 1 GB                             |

- a)   Measure the speed-up as more workers are added. Plot your speed-ups.

  ![Speed-up times for static scheduling](speedup_static.png){width=70% fig-align="center"}

- b) Estimate your parallel fraction according to Amdahl's law. How much (roughly) is parallelized?

    To estimate the parallel fraction while considering all experiments, an ODE fit is used on the observations. This yields following figure:
    
    ![Speed-up with fit for static scheduling](speedup_with_fit_static.png){width=70% fig-align="center"}

    Where roughly 84% is parallelized.


- c) What is your theoretical maximum speed-up according to Amdahl's law? How much of that did you achieve? How many cores did that take?
    
    With the former estimated parallel fraction, the maximum speed-up according to Amdahl's law is found as:

    $$S(\infty) = \frac{1}{1 - 0.84} \approx 6.23 $$

    From the figure in 5.a, it is seen that a speedup of around 4 is achieved with 16 parallel threads.

- d) How long would you estimate it would take to process all floorplans using your fastest parallel solution?
  
  Considering that the runtime of the statically parallelized script with 16 cores is approximately 51.145 seconds for 20 floorplans, the time per floorplan is about 2.557 seconds. Assuming this rate, processing all floorplans would take around 3 hours, 14 minutes, and 48 seconds.

  This demonstrates that static parallelization significantly reduced the original runtime, as about 8 hours has been cut off. This would mean that more than half of the original runtime has been removed with static parallelization.


**6.** The amount of iterations needed to reach convergence will vary from floorplan to floorplan. Re-do your parallelization experiment using dynamic scheduling.

**Requested hardware for the dynamic scheduling:**

| Resource Type | Specification                    |
|---------------|----------------------------------|
| CPU           | 16 cores (Intel Xeon Gold 6226R) |
| Memory        | 1 GB                             |

- a)   Did it get faster? By how much?

  ![Comparison of static and dynamic scheduling runtimes](compare_runtimes.png){width=70% fig-align="center"}

  The figure highlights runtimes of both static and dynamic parallelization where it is evident that static scheduling initially has an advantage compared to dynamic scheduling. This is most likely due to the overhead of assigning workers to tasks when there are few workers available.

  As stated in the problem formulation, the convergence will vary from floorplan to floorplan which would make dynamic scheduling as the obvious choice for parallelization. The advantage is seen at around 8 workers where the runtime becomes quicker than static scheduling, and for the rest of the workers it stays that way.

  So, in summary, if enough workers are available, then dynamic scheduling will be quicker than static scheduling due to the difference of convergence rates from floorplans. 

- b)   Did the speed-up improve or worsen?

  ![Speed-up with fit for dynamic scheduling](speedup_with_fit_dynamic.png){width=70% fig-align="center"}

  From the figure, equivalent to 5.b but script with dynamic scheduling, it becomes evident that speedup sees a significant improvement, and around 88% of the script is parallelized. The maximum achieved speedup is around 6 which is almost 1.5x better than what was achieved with static scheduling. 

  Moreover, comparing theoretical maximum speedups:
  
  $S_{dynamic}(\infty)=8.40$,

  $S_{static}(\infty)=6.23$,

  it is evident that the solution which utilizes dynamic scheduling will scale better with more number of workers due to the difference in computation time of each job handled by a single worker.


**7.** Implement another solution where you rewrite the jacobi function using Numba JIT on the CPU.

**Requested hardware for the Numba JIT implementation:**

| Resource Type | Specification                    |
|---------------|----------------------------------|
| CPU           | 20 cores (Intel Xeon Gold 6226R) |
| Memory        | 1 GB                             |

- a)    Run and time the new solution for a small subset of floorplans. How does the performance compare to the reference?

  For the reference implementation with 10 floorplans:

  | Time type | Duration |
  | --------  | -------   |
  | real      | 1m7.277s |
  | user	    | 1m6.409s |
  | sys	    | 0m0.202s  |

  For the new rewritten jacobi function with 10 floorplans:

  | Time type | Duration |
  | -------- | -------   |
  | real	   | 0m48.596s |
  | user	   | 0m47.648s |
  | sys	   | 0m0.230s  |

  This represents approximately a 28% performance improvement over the reference implementation.

![Convergence of Numba solver implementation](Sanity_Plots/Jacobi_Numba.png){width=60% fig-align="center"}

- b)    Explain your function. How did you ensure your access pattern works well with the CPU cache?

  For implementing the numba jit version of the jacobi function, we had to rewrite the indexing as numba doesn't allow for boolean array indexing, eg. 
  
```python
u_new_interior = u_new[interior_mask]
```

  Instead we created two new lists (ys and xs) using np.where. These lists contained the interior mask indexes in a row major order which allows for optimal cache storing. A loop over these lists was created where the difference for each index was calculated. If the difference is bigger than the current delta then it is assigned as delta.



- c)    How long would it now take to process all floorplans?

It will approximately take 6h9m


**8.** Implement another solution writing a custom CUDA kernel with Numba. To synchronize threads between each iteration, the kernel should only perform a single iteration of the Jacobi solver. Skip the early stopping criteria and just run for a fixed amount of iterations. Write a helper function which takes the same inputs as the reference implementation (except for the atol input which is not needed) and then calls your kernel repeatedly to perform the implementations.

**Requested hardware for the CUDA implementation:**

| Resource Type | Specification                    |
|---------------|----------------------------------|
| GPU           | 1 × GPU (exclusive_process mode) |
| CPU           | 4 cores (Intel Xeon Gold 6226R)  |
| Memory        | 2 GB                             |

- a)    Briefly describe your new solution. How did you structure your kernel and helper function?

Our CUDA implementation leverages massive parallelism on the GPU by performing point-wise updates in parallel. The solution consists of two main components:

1. A CUDA kernel function `jacobi_kernel` that:
   - Uses CUDA's grid-stride pattern to assign each thread to a specific grid point
   - Each thread independently computes the new temperature at its assigned point
   - Only updates interior points based on the provided mask
   - Boundary conditions are preserved by maintaining original values

2. A helper function `jacobi_cuda` that:
   - Transfers the initial temperature field and mask to the GPU
   - Pre-allocates device memory for computation
   - Sets up the execution grid with appropriate block sizes (16×16 threads per block)
   - Repeatedly calls the kernel for each iteration
   - Performs convergence checks periodically (every `interval` iterations) to minimize costly host-device transfers
   - Swaps pointers between iterations to avoid unnecessary memory operations

This approach significantly reduces computation time by executing thousands of point updates simultaneously on the GPU, while minimizing data transfers between CPU and GPU.

A key optimization in our CUDA implementation is how we handle convergence testing. Unlike the CPU implementations that check convergence after every iteration, we:

1. Compute residuals less frequently (every `interval` iterations) to reduce host-device transfers
2. Use the algebraic residual (the norm of the discrete Laplacian) 

The need to use algebraic residuals stems from the fact that maximum point-wise differences between iterations requires one to have the intermediate solutions from every iteration. This would require transferring solutions to the CPU every iteration. To be able to only do the convergence check every x iterations we need a different measure of convergence. The algebraic residual requires only information from the current iteration which enables us to only check for convergence occasionally. In our implementation we perform a check every 500 iterations. The algebraic residual based tolerance has been chosen by computing the residual during iterations from our reference solution. We chose a tolerance ensuring we get at least as good of a solution as obtained by using the solution change as convergence-criteria. 

This approach was critical for performance, as profiling (in task 10) showed that device-to-host transfers can consume up to 98% of execution time in naive GPU implementations. By reducing these transfers, we achieve much better utilization of the GPU's computational capabilities.

![Convergence of CUDA solver implementation](Sanity_Plots/Jacobi_CUDA.png){width=60% fig-align="center"}

- b)    Run and time the new solution for a small subset of floorplans. How does the performance compare to the reference?

  For the reference implementation with 10 floorplans:

  | Time type | Duration |
  | --------  | -------   |
  | real      | 1m7.277s |
  | user	    | 1m6.409s |
  | sys	    | 0m0.202s  |

  For the CUDA implementation with 10 floorplans:

  | Time type | Duration |
  | -------- | -------   |
  | real	   | 0m5.590s |
  | user	   | 0m4.319s |
  | sys	   | 0m0.482s  |

  This represents approximately a 92% reduction in runtime compared to the reference implementation, making it about 12 times faster.

- c)    How long would it now take to process all floorplans?

  Based on the timing of 5.59 seconds for 10 floorplans, processing all 4571 floorplans would take approximately 43m.


**9.**  Adapt the reference solution to run on the GPU using CuPy.

**Requested hardware for the CuPy implementation:**

| Resource Type | Specification                    |
|---------------|----------------------------------|
| GPU           | 1 × GPU (exclusive_process mode) |
| CPU           | 4 cores (Intel Xeon Gold 6226R)  |
| Memory        | 2 GB                             |

- a)    Run and time the new solution for a small subset of floorplans. How does the performance compare to the reference?

  For the reference implementation with 10 floorplans:

  | Time type | Duration |
  | --------  | -------   |
  | real      | 1m7.277s |
  | user	    | 1m6.409s |
  | sys	    | 0m0.202s  |

  For the CuPy implementation with 10 floorplans:

  | Time type | Duration |
  | --------  | -------   |
  | real	   | 0m18.088s |
  | user	   | 0m17.001s |
  | sys      | 0m0.363s  |

  This represents approximately a 73% reduction in runtime compared to the reference implementation, making it about 3.7 times faster.

![Convergence of CuPy solver implementation](Sanity_Plots/Jacobi_CuPy.png){width=60% fig-align="center"}

- b)    How long would it now take to process all floorplans?

It now takes approximately 2h18m

- c)    Was anything surprising about the performance?
Computing for 10 buildings yielded almost a 2x speed-up compared to the reference.


**10.** Profile the CuPy solution using the nsys profiler. What is the main issue regarding performance? (Hint: see exercises from week 10) Try to fix it.

  The main issue regarding performance is the device to host transfer, which is 98% of time spent.
  This is mainly due to the convergence check each iteration, and a new solution was implemented trying to combat this issue. The new function makes fewer convergence checks and uses the norm to check calculate the residuals. Timed on a small subset of floorplans we get the following:

| Time type | Duration |
| -------- | -------   |
| real     | 0m17.632s |
| user	   | 0m16.500s |
| sys	   | 0m0.368s  |

**11. (Optional)** Improve the performance of one or more of your solutions further.  For example, parallelize your CPU JIT solution. Or use job arrays to parallelize a solution over multiple jobs. How fast can you get?

For the parallel Numba JIT implementation with 10 floorplans:

| Time type | Duration |
| -------- | -------   |
| real	   | 0m19.853s |
| user	   | 0m38.156s |
| sys	   | 0m7.193s  |

This represents a 59% reduction in runtime compared to the regular Numba JIT implementation and a 70% reduction compared to the reference implementation.

The parallel implementation uses Numba's 

```python
@njit(parallel=True)
```

decorator and `prange` to parallelize computation across CPU cores.

The inherent sequential iterations of the Jacobi method cannot be parallelized (each iteration depends on the results of the previous one), but since the Jacobi method only updates points based on neighboring values from the previous iteration, we can parallelize the computation within each iteration. This allows for row-wise parallel processing.
